# **Data Project Rubric**: 
33Data Analysis with Python (Pandas & Matplotlib)

### 1. Project Overview 
Objective: Students should define the project's goal or main question. 
Example: Analyze which days of the week have the highest sales.
Data Source: Describe where the data comes from and how it might answer the question.
Example: This data source comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hhs/health-insurance

### 2. Data Collection and Loading 
Load Data: Use Pandas to load a dataset (CSV, Excel, or database).
Initial Check: Display the first few rows and basic information about the dataset, noting column names, types, and missing values.
Selection Options:
Choose a dataset you find interesting (Video game sales, Sports stats, Carbon emissions, etc.).
Choose which columns or data to focus on and drop the rest.

### 3. Data Cleaning and Preparation 
Handle Missing Values: Choose how to handle missing values (drop, fill, or leave as is).
Explain why you did this drop, fill, etc. 
Data Type Adjustments: Convert columns to appropriate types (e.g., dates to datetime).
Feature Engineering: Create at least one new feature from existing data.
Example: extracting the month from a date
Calculate the percentage
Combine first and last name columns into a full name column 

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
Descriptive Statistics: Provide summary statistics (mean, median, min, max) for numerical columns.
Data Visualizations:
Required: One visualization (e.g., line plot) if time-series data is relevant.
Optional: Additional visuals like bar charts for comparisons, histograms for distributions, or scatter plots for relationships.

### 5. Analysis and Insights
Findings: Summarize any patterns observed and address the main project question.
Supporting Data: Reference specific statistics or plot features to back up findings.
### 6. Conclusion and Recommendations (10 points)
Summarize: Present the main conclusions drawn from the analysis.
Recommendations: Based on findings, suggest actions or further analysis.

##### Optional Advanced Section (Bonus)
Advanced EDA: Use pair plots or correlation matrices to explore relationships.
Dashboards: Create a simple dashboard with Matplotlib or extend to Dash/Streamlit.
